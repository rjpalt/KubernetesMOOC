## Active Tasks

### Critical
- [ ] **Fix PostgreSQL Backup CronJob - Complete Rebuild**
  - **Why**: Current Azure Workload Identity setup is broken; backup functionality not working
  - **Scope**: Clean slate approach following documented infrastructure design
  - **Details**: See dedicated section below for step-by-step plan

### Critical
- [ ] Review deployment pipelines with Copilot for optimization and best practices
  - **Why**: Recent health check fixes need validation; ensure robust CI/CD patterns
  - **Scope**: Production, feature branch, and cleanup workflows

### Immediate
- [x] ~~Refactor workflows to use repository variables~~
  - **Why**: Remove hardcoded values, improve maintainability
- [ ] Implement Azure Functions webhook for database automation (Phase 1)
  - **Why**: Immediate database isolation without complex infrastructure
  - **Scope**: Branch create/delete webhooks ‚Üí Azure Functions ‚Üí Database provisioning
  - **Details**: See [Issue #18](https://github.com/rjpalt/KubernetesMOOC/issues/18) for Python implementation
- [ ] Test cleanup workflow with ex-3-8 branch lifecycle
  - **Why**: Verify automated cleanup works before considering done
- [ ] Document overlay maintenance in README
  - **Why**: Others need to know how to update HTTPRoute paths

### Short Term  
- [ ] Decide preview env trigger: PR-opened vs branch-created
  - **Why**: Need clear policy before implementing ExternalDNS
- [ ] Install ExternalDNS and cert-manager for preview domains
  - **Why**: Enable feature-branch.example.com URLs instead of path prefixes

### Future
- [ ] Database isolation per feature branch - Phase 2: Full infrastructure (see [Issue #17](https://github.com/rjpalt/KubernetesMOOC/issues/17))
  - **Why**: Complete preview environment setup after Phase 1 webhook automation
  - **Details**: ALB/Gateway, DNS, cert-manager integration
- [ ] Add Playwright E2E tests targeting live environments
  - **Why**: Validate complete workflows before production
- [ ] Set up GitOps with separate config repository
  - **Why**: Track actual deployed state, enable proper rollbacks

## PostgreSQL Backup CronJob - Rebuild Plan

### Current State Analysis
**Problems:**
- Service account in wrong namespace (`project` vs `default`)
- Service account name mismatch (`postgres-backup-prod-service-account` vs `backup-serviceaccount`)
- Azure Workload Identity environment variables not being injected
- Backup uploads failing due to authentication issues

**What Works:**
- PostgreSQL database connectivity ‚úÖ
- CronJob scheduling ‚úÖ
- Local backup creation ‚úÖ
- Script logic and error handling ‚úÖ

### Step 1: Clean Up Current Implementation
- [ ] Remove current broken service account
  ```bash
  kubectl delete serviceaccount postgres-backup-prod-service-account -n project
  ```
- [ ] Remove backup-service-account.yaml from manifests
- [ ] Update kustomization.yaml to remove backup-service-account.yaml
- [ ] Revert pg_cronjob.yaml to not use any service account (use default)

### Step 2: Follow Documented Infrastructure Design
Based on `.project/context.yaml`, the production backup should use:
- **Namespace**: `default` (not `project`)
- **Service Account**: `backup-serviceaccount`
- **Managed Identity**: `backup-production-identity` (50f96678-064c-463a-a3e3-2297a3b557f1)
- **Storage Container**: `database-backups`
- **Federated Credential**: Already configured for `system:serviceaccount:default:backup-serviceaccount`

### Step 3: Create Proper Service Account
- [ ] Create new service account in `default` namespace:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: backup-serviceaccount
    namespace: default
    annotations:
      azure.workload.identity/client-id: "50f96678-064c-463a-a3e3-2297a3b557f1"
    labels:
      azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
  ```

### Step 4: Update CronJob Configuration
- [ ] Move pg_cronjob to `default` namespace
- [ ] Update serviceAccountName to `backup-serviceaccount`
- [ ] Verify environment variables match storage account configuration
- [ ] Keep enhanced logging (LOG_LEVEL: DEBUG) for verification

### Step 5: Test and Validate
- [ ] Deploy updated manifests
- [ ] Verify Azure Workload Identity environment variables are injected
- [ ] Test backup creation and Azure upload
- [ ] Verify backups appear in `kubemoocbackups/database-backups` container
- [ ] Reduce logging to INFO once working

### Step 6: Consider Future Improvements
- [ ] Document why backup runs in `default` vs `project` namespace
- [ ] Consider moving to `project` namespace if workload identity can be reconfigured
- [ ] Add backup retention policy
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting for backup failures
- [ ] **Reduce sensitive logging in backup script for production**
  - **Why**: Current debug logging exposes Client ID, Tenant ID, and token content (security risk)
  - **Action**: Mask sensitive values, remove token content logging, add PRODUCTION_MODE flag
  - **Priority**: After authentication is confirmed working
- [ ] **Document Azure Workload Identity federated token usage in Azure-memos.md**
  - **Why**: Need reference for manually using az CLI inside AKS containers with federated tokens
  - **Content**: How to authenticate with `az login --federated-token` using environment variables
  - **Reference**: Current backup script implementation as working example

### Key Insights
- The infrastructure was designed with specific naming patterns
- Azure federated credentials are already configured correctly
- The issue is namespace/service account name mismatch, not Azure configuration
- Following the documented design should resolve authentication issues

### Workflow Optimizations
- [x] ~~Optimize CI/CD trigger paths for smarter rebuilds~~
  - **Current**: ~~Triggers on any `course_project/**` change (docs, manifests, etc.)~~
  - **Goal**: ~~Only trigger on source code changes (src/, Dockerfile, pyproject.toml)~~
  - **Why**: ~~Avoid unnecessary rebuilds/deployments for documentation changes~~
  - **Status**: **COMPLETED** - CI now only triggers on meaningful code changes
- [x] ~~Improve namespace creation efficiency in feature deployments~~
  - **Current**: ~~Always attempts `kubectl create namespace || true`~~
  - **Goal**: ~~Check if namespace exists first, then create only if needed~~
  - **Why**: ~~Cleaner logs, faster deployment, better error handling~~
  - **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Deployment now checks namespace existence before creation

### Security & Quality Automation
- [ ] Set up Dependabot for automated dependency updates
  - **Goal**: Monitor Python dependencies in pyproject.toml files for security vulnerabilities
  - **Config**: `.github/dependabot.yml` with schedule and PR grouping
  - **Why**: Proactive security patching, reduced maintenance overhead
- [ ] Configure CodeQL security scanning
  - **Goal**: Automated static analysis for Python code security issues
  - **Config**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` triggered on push/PR
  - **Why**: Early detection of security vulnerabilities in source code
- [ ] Enforce CI and security checks as PR merge requirements
  - **Goal**: Require CI pipeline + CodeQL to pass before merge to main
  - **Config**: Branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings
  - **Why**: Prevent broken or insecure code from reaching production

### Platform Features (Future)
- [ ] Document overlay maintenance requirement (README + Azure memos)
- [ ] Consider External Secrets Operator (ESO) with Azure Key Vault; optionally HashiCorp Vault for dynamic secrets
- [ ] Decide preview env trigger: PR-opened (recommended for cost) vs. branch-created; implement chosen workflow
- [ ] Prep platform installs (cluster-wide): ExternalDNS (Azure DNS) and cert-manager (Let's Encrypt), scoped to preview domain
- [ ] Per-feature hostnames with ExternalDNS + cert-manager (Preview Environments)
  - **Why**: Avoid path-prefix crowding and rewrite complexity in Gateway API
  - **Goal**: feature-<branch>.preview.example.com URLs with automatic TLS
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation automation with GitHub Pages
- [ ] GitOps repository implementation for better state tracking
- [ ] Playwright E2E testing with feature branch environments
