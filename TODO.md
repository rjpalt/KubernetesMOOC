## Active Tasks

### Immediate
- [x] ~~Refactor workflows to use repository variables~~
  - **Why**: Remove hardcoded values, improve maintainability
- [ ] Test cleanup workflow with ex-3-8 branch lifecycle
  - **Why**: Verify automated cleanup works before considering done
- [ ] Document overlay maintenance in README
  - **Why**: Others need to know how to update HTTPRoute paths

### Short Term  
- [ ] Decide preview env trigger: PR-opened vs branch-created
  - **Why**: Need clear policy before implementing ExternalDNS
- [ ] Install ExternalDNS and cert-manager for preview domains
  - **Why**: Enable feature-branch.example.com URLs instead of path prefixes

### Future
- [ ] Implement database isolation per feature branch
  - **Why**: Prevent feature tests affecting each other
- [ ] Add Playwright E2E tests targeting live environments
  - **Why**: Validate complete workflows before production
- [ ] Set up GitOps with separate config repository
  - **Why**: Track actual deployed state, enable proper rollbacks

---
- [ ] Document overlay maintenance requirement (README + Azure memos)
- [ ] Consider External Secrets Operator (ESO) with Azure Key Vault; optionally HashiCorp Vault for dynamic secrets
- [ ] Decide preview env trigger: PR-opened (recommended for cost) vs. branch-created; implement chosen workflow
- [ ] Prep platform installs (cluster-wide): ExternalDNS (Azure DNS) and cert-manager (Let‚Äôs Encrypt), scoped to preview domain

---

## FUTURE: Per-feature Hostnames with ExternalDNS + cert-manager (Preview Environments)

### Why
- Avoid path-prefix crowding and rewrite complexity in Gateway API
- Consistent, human-friendly URLs per feature (feature-<branch>.preview.example.com)
- Clean TLS with per-host or wildcard certificates; simpler browser/SameSite behavior
- Better isolation boundaries and easier cleanup (DNS and certs deprovision with namespace delete)
- Clearer observability (per-host metrics/logs) and policy controls (quotas, rate limits)

### What to Implement (High Level)
- DNS
  - Choose and provision base preview domain (e.g., preview.example.com) in Azure DNS
  - Delegate if needed; ensure CI/cluster has least-privilege to manage only this zone
- ExternalDNS (cluster-wide)
  - Install with Azure DNS provider; set txt-owner-id and domain filters to preview.example.com
  - Restrict to namespaces labeled for previews; enable garbage collection
- cert-manager (cluster-wide)
  - Install and configure ClusterIssuers (Let‚Äôs Encrypt staging/prod) using DNS-01 with Azure DNS
  - Option A: Wildcard cert for *.preview.example.com
  - Option B: Per-host certificates issued on demand
- Gateway design
  - Recommended: Use a dedicated ALB/Gateway for all feature namespaces (shared preview Gateway), keep production on a separate Gateway/ALB to reduce blast radius
  - Configure AllowedRoutes/namespaceSelectors so feature namespaces can bind only their own hosts
- App routing
  - Each feature namespace defines an HTTPRoute with host: feature-<branch>.preview.example.com pointing to its services (no path rewrites)
  - Ensure frontend/backend base URLs align with host-based routing
- CI/CD automation (per feature)
  - Trigger: PR-opened (recommended) to save resources; optionally support branch-created if desired
  - Steps: create namespace ‚Üí apply manifests with HOSTNAME variable ‚Üí wait for ExternalDNS record + cert ready ‚Üí post PR comment with URL
  - Cleanup on PR-closed: delete namespace; ExternalDNS removes DNS; cert-manager cleans up certs
- Guardrails
  - Apply resource quotas/limits per namespace; minimal replicas; autoscaling caps
  - Optional edge auth/IP allowlist for previews; baseline NetworkPolicies

### Azure-Native Provisioning Service (Recommended Enhancement)
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions directly managing Azure resources creates security and operational issues
- **Solution**: Azure Functions-based provisioning service with Azure-native identity management
- **Architecture**: GitHub Actions ‚Üí OIDC ‚Üí Azure Function ‚Üí Provision/Cleanup Resources
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced CI/CD permissions (only calls one Azure endpoint vs managing all resources)
  - Centralized provisioning logic with business rules, validation, resource limits
  - Better error handling, retry logic, and audit trails within Azure ecosystem
  - Consistent resource naming, tagging, and lifecycle management
  - Enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities for troubleshooting
- **Implementation**: 
  - Azure Function with Managed Identity and least-privilege Azure RBAC
  - HTTP triggers for provision/cleanup operations with structured request/response
  - Comprehensive logging with Application Insights for debugging complex scenarios
  - ARM/Bicep templates for consistent resource provisioning patterns

### Trigger Choice: PR-opened vs Branch-created
- PR-opened: More resource-savvy, aligns with review lifecycle; preferred default
- Branch-created: Faster feedback but can create unused environments; use only if contributors rely on early URLs

### Risks/Decisions
- ALB limits and cost: One shared preview ALB/Gateway vs per-env ALB; start with one shared preview ALB/Gateway and keep prod separate
- Certificate strategy: wildcard (simpler) vs per-host (granular)
- DNS permissions: scope creds to preview zone only
- Provisioning service complexity: Additional Azure component to maintain but significantly improves security posture

### Next Steps
- Decide base preview domain and add Azure DNS zone
- Approve design: shared preview ALB/Gateway, prod isolated; PR-opened trigger
- Add platform installs (ExternalDNS + cert-manager) with limited scope
- Design and implement Azure Functions provisioning service with comprehensive logging
- Add CI jobs for create/update and cleanup on PR lifecycle

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitation: Shared Database
**Current Setup**: All feature environments share the same PostgreSQL database as production.

**Problem**: Data isolation issues - feature tests can affect each other and production data.

**Future Enhancement**: Each feature environment should have its own database instance:
- **Option 1**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL per feature branch
- **Option 2**: PostgreSQL pods with persistent volumes per namespace  
- **Option 3**: In-memory databases for testing (fastest, ephemeral)

**Implementation Priority**: MEDIUM - Current shared setup works for learning/demo purposes, but proper isolation needed for real development workflows.

# TODO: OpenAPI Documentation Automation (FUTURE)

## Goal
Automatically extract OpenAPI specs from todo-app and todo-backend services, centralize them in course_project root, and publish via GitHub Pages with automatic updates on main branch merges.

## Prerequisites to Setup First
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages for this repository
- [ ] Enable GitHub Actions for this repository
- [ ] Verify docker-compose.yaml works for both services

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Directory Structure Setup
```
course_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todo-app-openapi.json
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todo-backend-openapi.json
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (Swagger UI)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ extract-openapi.sh
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ update-openapi.yml
```

### Phase 2: Manual Process (Learning)
- [ ] Create docs/api/ directory structure
- [ ] Write script to start services via docker-compose
- [ ] Write script to fetch OpenAPI specs from running services
  - todo-app: http://localhost:8000/openapi.json
  - todo-backend: http://localhost:8001/openapi.json
- [ ] Create basic Swagger UI HTML page
- [ ] Test manual process locally

### Phase 3: GitHub Actions Automation
- [ ] Create workflow file (.github/workflows/update-openapi.yml)
- [ ] Use existing GitHub Actions:
  - `docker/compose-action` - Start services with docker-compose
  - `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action` - Auto-commit if specs changed
  - `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Phase 4: Workflow Logic
1. **Trigger**: On push to main branch
2. **Health Check**: Wait for services to be ready (ports 8000/8001)
3. **Extract**: Fetch /openapi.json from both services
4. **Compare**: Check if specs have actually changed (not just timestamps)
5. **Commit**: Auto-commit updated specs if changed
6. **Deploy**: Update GitHub Pages with new Swagger UI

### Key GitHub Actions to Use
- `docker/compose-action` - Service orchestration
- `stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action` - Git automation
- `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` - Pages deployment
- Custom scripts for OpenAPI extraction and comparison

# TODO: GitOps Repository Implementation (FUTURE)

## Problem Statement
**Current Issue**: Manifests use placeholder tags that drift from actual deployed state. Local deployments intentionally broken to enforce CI/CD-only workflow.

## GitOps Solution Overview
**Concept**: Separate application code repository from configuration repository, with CI/CD pipeline automatically updating config repo with real image tags.

### Architecture
```
App Repo (this one)           Config Repo (separate)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile              ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todo-backend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/      ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ todo-frontend/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build.yml           ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ todo-cron/
                            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/
                                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deploy.yml
```

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] **Create separate config repository** (`KubernetesMOOC-config`)
- [ ] **Move manifests** from app repo to config repo
- [ ] **Update CI/CD pipeline** to commit real image tags to config repo
- [ ] **Deploy ArgoCD/Flux** to watch config repo and auto-deploy changes
- [ ] **Remove placeholder tags** - config repo always has real, deployable manifests

### Benefits
‚úÖ **Git reflects reality**: Config repo always shows actual deployed state  
‚úÖ **Local deployment works**: Real tags mean `kubectl apply` works again  
‚úÖ **Audit trail**: All changes tracked in Git history  
‚úÖ **Rollback capability**: Git revert = instant rollback  
‚úÖ **Multi-environment**: Same pattern for dev/staging/prod with different branches

### Learning Progression
```
Current: App Repo + Placeholder Tags ‚Üí GitOps: App Repo + Config Repo + ArgoCD
```

**Status**: Planned for later exercises after mastering basic Kubernetes concepts.

# TODO: Feature Environment Database Isolation (FUTURE)

## Current Limitation
All feature environments share the same PostgreSQL database as production, creating potential data conflicts and test isolation issues.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Azure Database for PostgreSQL per Feature Branch
```yaml
# In deployment workflow
- name: Create feature database
  run: |
    # Create Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server
    az postgres flexible-server create \
      --name "todo-db-feature-${BRANCH_NAME}" \
      --resource-group kubernetes-learning \
      --sku-name Standard_B1ms \
      --storage-size 32 \
      --tier Burstable \
      --database-name todoapp
```

### Option 2: PostgreSQL StatefulSet per Namespace
```yaml
# Deploy dedicated postgres instance in each feature namespace
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: postgres-statefulset
  namespace: feature-branch-name
```

### Option 3: Ephemeral In-Memory Database
```yaml
# Use SQLite or in-memory postgres for fast, isolated testing
env:
  - name: DATABASE_URL
    value: "sqlite:///tmp/feature_test.db"
```

## Implementation Considerations
- **Cost**: Option 1 most expensive, Option 3 cheapest
- **Speed**: Option 3 fastest startup, Option 1 slowest
- **Isolation**: All options provide full isolation
- **Persistence**: Options 1&2 persist data, Option 3 ephemeral
- **Production Similarity**: Option 1 most similar to production

## Recommended Approach
Start with **Option 2** (StatefulSet per namespace) for good balance of isolation, cost, and production similarity.

# TODO: Playwright E2E Testing with Feature Branch Environments

## High-Level Implementation
- **CI/CD Extension**: Add E2E job after feature environment deployment
- **Test Target**: Live feature environments via Gateway API (not mocks)
- **Pipeline Flow**: CI ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí E2E Tests ‚Üí Block/Allow PR merge
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Test against real services in isolated namespaces

## Key Benefits
- Validates complete user workflows before production
- Leverages existing feature environment infrastructure
- Fast feedback loop (~10-15 minutes from push to results)
- Production-like testing with real Gateway API routing

## Implementation Steps
1. Add Playwright tests in `course_project/e2e-tests/`
2. Extend `ci.yml` with E2E job after deployment
3. Configure tests to target feature environment URLs
4. Set up test result reporting and PR blocking

**Priority**: HIGH - Natural next step for production readiness
**Effort**: MEDIUM - Builds on existing infrastructure
