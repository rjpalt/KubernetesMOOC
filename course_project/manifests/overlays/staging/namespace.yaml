# Staging Namespace Definition
#
# This namespace is defined in the staging overlay (not base/shared/) to:
#   1. Enable staging-specific gateway label (dev-gateway-access=allowed)
#   2. Prevent Kustomize transformation conflicts
#   3. Support agc-feature-gateway routing requirements
#   4. Use different label than production (dev-gateway-access vs gateway-access)
#
# Gateway: agc-feature-gateway (development/staging gateway)
# Routing: Hostname-based via staging.23.98.101.23.nip.io
