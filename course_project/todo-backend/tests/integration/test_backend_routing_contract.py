"""
Backend-side routing architecture tests.

These tests validate that the backend maintains its side of the routing contract:
- Backend expects JSON input, not form data
- Backend routes are designed for API consumption, not direct browser access
- Backend doesn't accidentally accept form data (which would mask routing bugs)

CRITICAL: If backend starts accepting form data directly, it could mask
routing misconfigurations where /todos goes directly to backend instead
of through frontend's form-to-JSON conversion.
