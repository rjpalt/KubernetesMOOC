# Refactored Todo App Architecture

## Overview

This project has been refactored from a monolithic `main.py` file into a proper modular architecture following software engineering best practices. Because apparently someone finally realized that 311 lines of spaghetti code isn't maintainable.

## New Architecture

```

├── __init__.py
├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── settings.py          # Centralized configuration management
├── models/

│   └── image.py             # Pydantic data models
├── services/

└── core/

    ├── cache.py             # Image cache management
    └── lifespan.py          # Application lifespan management
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Configuration**: All settings centralized in `src/config/settings.py`
- **Business Logic**: Extracted to service layer (`src/services/`)
- **API Layer**: Clean route handlers in `src/api/routes/`
- **Data Models**: Proper Pydantic models in `src/models/`
- **Infrastructure**: Cache management and lifespan in `src/core/`

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
- Proper dependency injection instead of global variables
- Services receive their dependencies through constructor injection
- FastAPI dependencies for clean route handlers

### 3. **Testability**
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Clear interfaces between layers
- No more global state pollution

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Single Responsibility Principle applied to each module
- Clear module boundaries and interfaces
- Easy to extend and modify individual components

### 5. **Configuration Management**
- Environment-based configuration
- Type-safe settings with proper defaults
- Centralized configuration access

## Usage

### Running the Original Monolith
```bash
python main.py
```

### Running the Refactored Version
```bash
python main_refactored.py
```

Both versions provide identical functionality, but the refactored version is:
- More maintainable
- More testable
- More scalable
- Actually follows software engineering principles

## Environment Variables

The refactored version supports the same environment variables as the original:

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- `HOST`: Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: false)
- `IMAGE_CACHE_PATH`: Path for image cache (default: ./images)
- `IMAGE_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES`: Image update interval (default: 10)
- `PICSUM_URL`: Lorem Picsum URL (default: https://picsum.photos/1200)
- `HTTP_TIMEOUT`: HTTP client timeout (default: 30.0)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level (default: INFO)
- `TEMPLATE_DIRECTORY`: Template directory (default: templates)

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Modularity**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be unit tested in isolation
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without modifying existing code
5. **Code Quality**: Follows SOLID principles and clean architecture patterns
6. **Developer Experience**: Much easier to understand and work with

## What Was Wrong With the Original?

The original `main.py` was a textbook example of what NOT to do:
- Mixed responsibilities (API routes, business logic, background tasks, configuration)
- Global state pollution
- Tight coupling between components
- No separation of concerns
- Difficult to test
- Hard to maintain and extend

The refactored version addresses all these issues while maintaining the exact same functionality.
