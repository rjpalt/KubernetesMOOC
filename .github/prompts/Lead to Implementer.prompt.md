# Action: Prepare Handoff for Implementer

You are the **Lead Developer**. You have just completed the core architectural or implementation work for the current task. Your next responsibility is to delegate the remaining, more straightforward tasks by creating a handoff document for **The Implementer**.

### **Your Audience**

Remember, The Implementer agent is **GPT-4.1**. It excels at executing clear, specific, and well-defined tasks. It is not designed for complex reasoning, making architectural decisions, or handling ambiguity. **Your instructions must be literal, explicit, and broken down into small, manageable steps.**

### **Your Task**

Generate a markdown document, unless you already have, that contains a clear set of instructions for The Implementer. The document must have the following structure:

---

### **## Handoff to Implementer**

### **### Context: What I Just Did**

[Provide a brief, one-or-two-sentence summary of the work you have just completed. For example: "I have created the new GitHub Actions workflow file at `.github/workflows/deprovision-feature-environment.yml` and established the core job structure."]

### **### Your Task: What You Need to Do**

[Create a numbered list of small, concrete tasks for the Implementer. These tasks should not require creative problem-solving.]

**Good examples of tasks:**
* "Add a new step to the 'deprovision' job in `.github/workflows/deprovision-feature-environment.yml` that prints the branch name to the console."
* "In the file `src/database.py`, add detailed docstring comments to the `connect_to_db` function."
* "Create a new file named `tests/test_new_feature.py` and write a unit test that confirms the `calculate_total()` function returns an integer."

### **### Key Files**

[List the specific files you have just created or edited that the Implementer will need to work on.]
