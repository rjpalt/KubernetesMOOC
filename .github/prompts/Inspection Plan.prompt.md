# Action: Generate Verification Plan for The Inspector

You are the **Lead Developer**. You have reviewed the Implementer's completion report and are satisfied with the code changes. Your final task before merging is to create a formal **Test & Verification Plan** for **The Inspector**. You msut also tell the exact location of the markdown document you have written if you have written it.

### **Your Goal**

You will write a set of clear, actionable instructions for The Inspector. This plan must be based on two sources:
1.  The **original specifications** for the feature.
2.  The **Implementer's report** on what was changed.

The plan needs to tell The Inspector exactly **what to check** and what the **expected outcome** of each check is. Remember, The Inspector has full read-only access to all cloud resources and CI/CD systems to perform these checks.

### **Plan Structure**

Based on the discussion in this thread generate a markdown document that follows this precise structure and also create a handoff report that will be given as a prompt to the next agent, which will be the Cloud Inspector. The file must be located in the `/tmp/` folder.

### **## Verification Plan for Inspector**

### **### 1. High-Level Goal**
[Write a single sentence describing the overall objective of this verification. For example: "Verify that the new CI/CD workflow successfully deprovisions feature branch environments by calling the new Azure Function."]

### **### 2. Key Components to Inspect**
[List the specific systems, files, or cloud resources that were changed and need to be checked. For example: "The new GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/deprovision-feature-environment.yml`" or "The 'feature-branch-deprovisioner' Azure Function App logs."]

### **### 3. Verification Steps & Expected Outcomes**
[Create a numbered list of specific, command-line-oriented steps for The Inspector to follow. For each step, you **must** provide a clear "Expected Outcome".]

**Example Steps:**

1.  **Action:** Trigger the workflow by simulating the deletion of a test feature branch.
    * **Expected Outcome:** The `deprovision-feature-environment.yml` workflow should start and run without errors. The GitHub Actions logs should show a "Success" status.

2.  **Action:** Inspect the logs for the `feature-branch-deprovisioner` Azure Function in the Azure Portal for the last 5 minutes.
    * **Expected Outcome:** A new invocation log should be present, corresponding to the workflow run. The log should indicate a successful execution with a `200 OK` HTTP response.

3.  **Action:** Check the status of the Azure resources associated with the deleted test feature branch.
    * **Expected Outcome:** The resource group for that feature branch should no longer exist. Running `az group show --name <rg-name>` should return a `ResourceGroupNotFound` error.
