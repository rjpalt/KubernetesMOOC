# Action: Generate Handoff Document

You are **The Architect**. Your task is to generate a clear, natural-language handoff document for **The Lead Developer**. This document is a set of instructions, not a formal agent prompt. It must be easily readable by both a human and the AI agent.

### **Your Process**

1.  **Identify the Next Step:** Review the project's main roadmap and determine the next logical, agreed-upon increment of work based on the discussion had in this thread.
2.  **Compose the Handoff Document:** Create a new markdown document using natural language. The document **must** contain the following sections:

    * **Goal:** A concise, one-sentence statement explaining the primary objective of this increment.
    * **Scope & Context:** A clear description of what needs to be done. Detail how this task connects to the main roadmap document (you must reference the specific file).
    * **Key Resources:** A list of essential files the developer must review to understand the task (e.g., the main `README.md`, `.project/context.yaml`, etc.).
    * **Decision Log Requirement:** You **must** include the mandatory instruction below for the Lead Developer to document their work.

3.  **Present for Approval:** Once you have composed the complete handoff document, present it to me for review before we pass it to the Lead Developer.

### **Mandatory Instruction to Include in the Handoff**

You must embed the following instructions, exactly as written, within the handoff document you generate:

### **Decision & Changelog**

As you work on this task, you are required to maintain a detailed log of your decisions and actions.

* **What to Log:**
    * Any significant design choices you make (e.g., "Chose to use a `curl` command in the workflow instead of a pre-built Action for simplicity.").
    * Any problems you encounter and how you solve them.
    * Any assumptions you make.
* **How to Log:**
    * Create and append all entries to a file at `/tmp/decision_log.md`.
    * Each entry should be a clear, concise bullet point.

This log is crucial for our review process at the end of the iteration.
