Perform a session history dump. Create a concise summary of this thread for your future self, capturing the primary objectives, key steps taken, and the rationale behind our decisions. The goal is to create a memory file that will allow you to instantly resume this session's context later.

The output must be a Markdown file saved to /tmp/memory/Lead/. The filename should be aptly named based on the session's topic and must end with the .memory.md extension.

Example Filename: UserOnboarding_API_Integration.memory.md
