Perform a comprehensive session architecture dump. Synthesize the strategic decisions, architectural patterns, and long-term design considerations explored in this thread. Create a memory artifact for your future self that encapsulates not just the 'what' and 'how,' but the critical 'why' behind the architectural choices. This will enable you to seamlessly reintegrate into this context in future sessions.

The output must be a Markdown file saved to /tmp/memory/Architect/. The filename should reflect the core architectural domain of the session and must end with the .memory.md extension.

Example Filename: Distributed_System_Scalability_Strategy.memory.md
