# GitHub Secrets for ACT Local Testing
# 
# This file provides example values for GitHub secrets needed when testing
# GitHub Actions workflows locally using ACT (https://github.com/nektos/act).
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to .secrets (which is gitignored)
#   2. Update the values below with your test credentials
#   3. Run: act --job test-backend
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the actual .secrets file - it contains credentials!

# PostgreSQL test database credentials
# These are used by the GitHub Actions workflow for database testing
TEST_POSTGRES_USER=test_user
TEST_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test_password123

# Note: The workflow automatically detects ACT execution using github.actor == 'nektos/act'
# and sets these environment variables for database connectivity during local testing.
